1. Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList, 2020, ACL.
    - core: new evaluation methodology (checklist) for NLP models.
    - shortcomings of existing methods:
        1. primary methods like accuracy: performance overestimation, doesn’t help how to fix.
        2. alternative methods like adversarial changes: task-specifical, no comprehensive guidance.
    - ideas and improvements:
        1. Potential tests are structured as a matrix with different test types suggested.
    - can't understand.

1. Don’t Stop Pretraining: Adapt Language Models to Domains and Tasks, 2020, ACL.
    - core: task-specifical or multi-phase adaptive pretraining still helps.



1. Vocabulary Learning via Optimal Transport for Neural Machine Translation, ACL, 2021.  
    - task: generate *token dictionary*
    - core idea: borrow *Marginal Utility* and propose MUV. propose a relaxation in the formulation of discrete optimal transport to optimize objective.
